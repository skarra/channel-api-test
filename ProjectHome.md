A simple test app for Channel API under Python/Google App Engine. Channel API provides support for two way communication between browser and server. This is a simple echo service that broadcasts a received message to all clients. This allows the client to see the latency of the round trip, and if the clocks are synchronized (multiple clients on the same machine) then you can see the time difference in sending to each client.
